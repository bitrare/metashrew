# Welcome To Sandshrew

## The Developer Gateway to Bitcoin

Meet Sandshrew, a comprehensive and extensible resource for developers building Bitcoin and ordinals native applications. Sandshrew is an all-inclusive JSON-RPC service tailored specifically for developers seeking full access to Bitcoin compatible blockchain datasets. We provide top level indexes for ease of access to Bitcoin datasets for developers.

### What is Sandshrew?

Sandshrew is your gateway to the Bitcoin blockchain and the infinite space of transformations on its underlying chaindata. Its purpose is to let developers harness the full potential of Bitcoin data, allowing quick and efficient access to any datasets native to Bitcoin L1, or supported Bitcoin compatible networks. Low level usage of sandshrew permits the orchestration of wallet services, block explorers, but also fully qualified metaprotocols built on higher order structures such as inscriptions. This means it is possible to deploy BRC-20 marketplaces, lending protocols, or even more immersive protocols to the Sandshrew runtime, enabling any range of Bitcoin-native application stacks.

### Key Features of Sandshrew

* **Bitcoin Core Indexing:** By indexing Bitcoin blockchain data, Sandshrew ensures that you have access both real-time and historical information about blocks, transactions, wallet balances, and more.
* **Esplora-Based Indexer:** Our Esplora-based indexer allows you to perform specific transaction searches, retrieve block details, and delve into various blockchain activities effortlessly.
* **Ordinals Indexer:** Sandshrew provides access to both satoshis and ordinals inscriptions and content. This facilitates the tracking and transfer of satoshis, enabling you to work with Bitcoin ordinals in a more granular and organized manner.
* **Bitcoin Inscriptions:** Support for Bitcoin inscriptions allow you to access and organize inscribed satoshis. This enables the creation of applications built on bitcoin-native digital artifacts without the need for a separate sidechain.
* **BRC-20 Integration:** Sandshrew extends its capabilities to index BRC-20 data, making it easy for users to access information on BRC-20 tokens that have been minted on the Bitcoin blockchain.
